# Docomomo MN / US Modern Registry Map

Docomomo MN's Minnesota Modern Registry documents the wide array of buildings, sites, and neighborhoods of the modern movement in the state of Minnesota and throughout the Midwest. Our team from Prime Digital Academy upgraded the initial version of the map with the following: 

* Responsive design that is mobile friendly
* Clustering of sites allows for easier navigation and reduced delay on map load
* Dynamic map filters, searches, site details page, and SQL queries allowing for an expandable database
* Individual pages for each site with details
* Login allows administrators to edit, add, and delete sites from database
